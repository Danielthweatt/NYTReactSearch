# NYT React Search 
This is my first full stack MERN app. It is an app 
that searches the New York Times via their web API. 
## How to Use 
This app searches the NYT for articles based on 
information entered by the user in a form on the 
homepage. The NYT returns articles based on 
relevance to the search, the first five of which 
the app displays on the homepage. The user can 
click on the title of the article to read it or 
can click on the save button below the article to 
save the article in the app's database. In the 
navbar is a link which takes the user to a page 
which displays all of the articles saved in the app's 
database. On this page, the user can click the 
delete button below an individual article to 
remove it from the app's database, or, again, 
click on the article's title to read the article.
